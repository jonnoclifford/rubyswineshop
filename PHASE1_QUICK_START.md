# Phase 1 Quick Start Guide

## What's New in Your Admin Panel

### New "Layout" Tab

You now have a new **Layout** tab in your admin panel (it's the first tab). This gives you control over:

1. **Show/Hide Sections** - Turn any section on or off with a toggle switch
2. **Color Schemes** - Change the background and text colors for each section

## How to Use It

### Hiding a Section

1. Go to `/admin` and login
2. Click the **Layout** tab (first tab with the grid icon)
3. Find the section you want to hide (e.g., "What's On")
4. Click the toggle switch to turn it OFF
5. Click **Save Changes**
6. Check your site - the section is now hidden!

**Example Use Case:** Hide the "What's On" section during a quiet period when you have no events.

### Changing Colors

1. Go to `/admin` and click the **Layout** tab
2. Find the section you want to change (e.g., "Hero Banner")
3. Use the dropdown on the right to select a color scheme:
   - **Light (Cream background)** - Cream background, navy text
   - **Dark (Navy background)** - Navy background, cream text
   - **Terracotta** - Terracotta background, cream text
   - **Cream Alternative** - Cream background with terracotta headings
4. Click **Save Changes**
5. Check your site - the colors have changed!

**Example Use Case:** Make the "About" section stand out by changing it to the Terracotta color scheme.

## Tips

1. **Preview Your Changes**
   - After saving, click the "Preview" button in the header
   - This opens your live site in a new tab
   - Changes appear within 10 seconds

2. **Experiment Freely**
   - All changes are saved to GitHub
   - You can always revert if you don't like something
   - Try different color combinations to see what looks best

3. **Mobile Testing**
   - Check your site on mobile after making changes
   - Some color schemes may look different on small screens

   - Show it again when you have something to promote
   - No developer needed!

## Common Questions
